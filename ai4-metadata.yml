title: Apple tree blossom image segmentation
summary: We suggest a 2D image segmentation model based on UNET algorithm to segment images with blossoming apple tree
description: |-
  Apple flowers are very sensitive to temperature. The study of their development makes it possible to study climate change. 

  This module proposes a model for the segmentation of apple blossom images. This model is based on the UNET algorithm. We suggest a tool for inference of images and a tool for retrain a model. The model in inference and retraining is a Tensorflow model in h5 format.
